    content: "A Big Thank You to Always Classic Cars Team. Booking the Rolls Royce for my daughter’s wedding through Always Classic cars was a decision I would live to cherish. From the very first call up until the very end, it was a pleasure dealing with Silvia and Vince. They were friendly, highly professional and very easy to talk to.    Our Chauffeur, Colin arrived bang on time and mingled with all of us as if he had known us all for a long time.Thank you Silvia, Vince and Colin for all your assistance and for making Sarah and Aaron’s Wedding day even more special."

    Dear all at Always Classic Cars,
    Elena and myself were extremely happy with the way things were run last Sunday. Your companies attention to detail in the lead up to the day was excellent and no doubt helped things run as smoothly as they did.
    We must also mention how helpful, friendly and reliable Owen was as a driver towards everyone who rode in the car with him on the day.
    We will definitely be recommending your company to as many people as we can.
    Thanks once again for everything.
    Kind Regards
    "

    content: "Vincent and the team at Always Classic Cars were absolutely fabulous to deal with, from start to finish. They really made our day. Our driver on the day, Owen, was hilarious and wonderful to have around. Our car, the 1961 Rolls Royce Phantom V (Silver / Grey), was truly spectacular and had an edge about it that made it really stand out. We can’t recommend Always Classic Cars enough – they were brilliant."

    content: "We could not have been happier with your service on our wedding day. Joe and Harry were so professional and amazing chauffeurs. They looked after us so very well on the day and went above an beyond what we expected. The chauffeurs were always close by to lend a helping hand with my dress for photos and also assisted the bridesmaids with their bouquets when needed.
    The cars were gorgeous, clean and so comfortable. I really felt like a princess and my wedding day was everything I dreamed it would be! I could not recommend your team highly enough!
    Thank you again for your services on our wedding day."
